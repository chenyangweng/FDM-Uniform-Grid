# FDM-Uniform-Grid
MATLAB codes that generate finite difference matrix (FDM) for uniform grid.
The code can be used to solve 1D or 2D ordinary/partial differential equations. Within the computational domain, symmetric stencils (central difference) with 2nd, 4th, 6th... order of accuracy can be chosen; near and at the domain boundaries, skewed stencils with the same order of accuracy are used.


See  [readme.pdf](doc/readme.pdf) for detailed explanation.
